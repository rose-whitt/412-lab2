COMP 412, Fall 2016

This directory contains the scripts and tools to perform lab 2
code check 2.

To invoke code check 2, type

    ~comp412/students/lab2/code_check_2/CodeCheck2 <alloc path>

where <alloc path> is the Linux path to your allocator. For
example, if you ran the code check in the directory containing
your allocator and your allocator was named "412alloc", you 
would type 

    ~comp412/students/lab2/code_check_2/CodeCheck2 ./412alloc

You can copy the CodeCheck2 script to your own directory and 
invoke it, or you can specify its full path name.  All of the
other tools are hard coded, with full path names, into the scripts.

You should see, as a result, some lines that document when and
where the test took place, followed by reports on how your 
allocator did on the test blocks.  The code check first tries
your allocator with k = 7, then with k = 5.

The report might look like:

The CodeCheck2 script leaves two files in your home directory,
CC2a.log and CC2b.log; in the event that the CodeCheck does not
work, those log files may provide some insight into the problem.
