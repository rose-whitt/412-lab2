COMP 412, Fall 2015

This directory contains the set of scripts, C programs, and 
test blocks used to perform Lab 2 code check #1.

To invoke code check #1, type

   ~comp412/students/lab2/code_check_1/CodeCheck1  <path>

where <path> is the Linux pathname for your allocator.

You can copy CodeCheck1 to your own directory, or invoke it by
giving the full Linux pathname.  All of the other tools are 
hard coded, with full pathnames, into the scripts.

You should see, as a result, a several lines of output that 
document when the test took place, where the test took place, 
and which allocator was tested, followed by reports on five 
blocks named cc1.i through cc5.i. Those reports look like:

--------------------
Checking 'cc1.i'
Program 'cc1.i'		correctly executed in 20 cycles

--> Code Check: failed, with 5 reassignments.
--------------------

or

--------------------
Checking 'cc1.i'
Program 'cc1.i'		correctly executed in 20 cycles

--> Code Check: passed.
--------------------

The two critical features are the words 

"correctly executed" -- means the output statements matched the 
	   	        right answer in the comment fields at the 
			top of the file

"passed" or "failed" -- verdict on the correctness of your renaming pass.
